# Build and serve the Specter DIY browser simulator in a container.

#   docker build -t specter-sim .
#   docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8765:8765 specter-sim
#
# then open http://localhost:8765/. The first stage only wraps run-local.sh, so
# the build logic stays in web/browser/build-browser.sh. It downloads the
# firmware and Emscripten and takes several minutes. The second stage keeps just
# the static site and a Python web server, so the final image is small and
# `docker run` starts immediately. The build stage itself needs several GB of
# disk in Docker's build cache (`docker builder prune` frees it afterwards).
#
# Build argument: SPECTER_REF=<tag|branch|sha> simulates another firmware
# revision. Simulator provenance is read from the .git directory that is copied
# into the image, so build from a git clone, not from a ZIP download.

# Both stages use the same base image, pinned by digest. Update it deliberately:
# docker pull ubuntu:24.04, then copy the new digest.
